<p class="dropcap">The attitude and the pretensions
of the “medicine man” may
perhaps have had some value in the days
when the multitude was full of superstition
and had no scientific knowledge, but we
hope those days of ignorance have passed,
though we fear superstition remains. The
“medicine man” was a more or less
clever poseur, who used his small amount
of knowledge to conceal his very large
amount of ignorance. The medical profession,
till the more recent years, cannot
be entirely acquitted of the same sort of
dishonesty, but a new era of open-mindedness
and honesty has, I think, begun.</p>

<p>To get any real success in the treatment
of disease, we must get confidences, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
one-sided, but on both sides, between
ourselves and our patients, and so alone
shall we get that co-operation without
which there can be little expectation of
success. At present we see this success
more in the wonderful results of psychotherapy
than in the treatment of objective
disease, but I firmly maintain that mutual
trust will prove its great value in this
also. Is it reasonable to expect that men
of equal learning and intelligence as ourselves
will accept our treatment and
advice without knowing the rationale of
them? Should we do it in the case of
legal or religious matters? Our patients
know as well as we do that medical
knowledge is in a continuous state of
flux and that as yet we are nowhere near
finality. The dazzling garment of omniscience
will be discovered to be the
somewhat shop-worn cloak of ignorance.
A wise and observant patient can help
us enormously in the investigation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
a difficult problem in disease, for the subjective
symptoms are often as important
as the objective. What the eye does not
see may be there all the time.</p>

<p>The history of the world right up
to the present time has shown the futility
of dividuality as against individuality both
in politics and religion. The greater part
of our Christian teaching is against separateness,
and towards mutual love, consideration,
and help. For this reason I
have tried to write so that all may grasp
the hope and possibility of a longer and
more effectual life. Co-operation is the
watchword of the future, isolation the
disease and explanation of the past.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Why do we die so long before
our time? And what do we
die of? These are the two most crucial
questions, as far as this life is concerned,
that affects us all, but which most of us
seem content to ignore.</p>

<p>Putting on one side the accidents of
life—and among the accidents I include
the acute diseases, such as pneumonia,
rheumatic fever, and the infectious
diseases, which attack from without, and
the so far unexplained cancer—we must
allow that our lives and our health are
to a great extent in our own keeping,
and of our own making. Three score
years and ten was David’s estimate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
the working years of a man’s life, but
under modern conditions of improved
sanitation the term of life should be at
least four score years and ten, and this
extra 20 per cent. should not be a time
of pain and sorrow, but of peace and
rest, with still some capacity for work.</p>

<p>Many of us used to be content to
answer the first question, “Why do we
die?” by saying our time had come.
The unreflecting but so-called religious
person seemed to think that God had
placed a time limit against each individual
when he came into the world.
This is pure fatalism, and unworthy of
the name of reason or of faith in the
Divine justice. “Let us eat and drink,
for to-morrow we die” is almost the
logical position of such minds. We cannot
hope to solve individually or in
detail the mysteries of life and death,
why one is cut off in the full tide of his
energy, and another, who seems to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
going out on the ebb, remaineth. But
we must put these following questions
honestly to ourselves—Are free will,
scientific work, knowledge, self-restraint,
and self-denial to be so much wasted
powder? Are we to work out our destiny,
the sport of chance, hopelessly, illogically,
without ambition and without a
healthy pride in our work? Is the man
who spends his life in riotous living, in
over-eating and drinking, and in committing
every physiological sin that he
can think of, to live as long and as
healthily as the wise and sober man?
Has the great Father of us all given us
no motive for life, no work to do for
Him or for our brothers?</p>

<p>Must not we, as separate sections of
the Divine image and of His all-pervading
spiritual force, endeavour with all our
strength and knowledge to prolong the
life given us to the utmost limit? Surely
the fact of our life, the gift of our life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
becomes a great personal responsibility,
an acknowledged debt to our Maker that
we can only repay by regarding it as a
treasure to be daily cared for and cherished.
Thus the promotion of health
and the prevention of disease must
manifestly be our first considerations,
for without health our output of work
ceases, or becomes both in quantity and
character a poor thing.</p>

<p>The despairing cry of “Why was I
born?” comes to most of us in the
sorrows and tragedies of life, but it is
the cry of faithlessness, of relativity, of
blindness to the sure, but half-seen purposes
of the Absolute God.</p>

<p>That which we in our presumption
are pleased to call civilization, should
certainly further such aims for health,
but the whole story of the world, of
past and gone kingdoms, and of our
own times also, show that civilization
works up to a point of luxury that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
defeats and destroys itself. Babylon,
Egypt, and Rome all testify to this end.
These old civilizations perished, perhaps,
more from enervating luxury and dissipation
than from violence; though some of
them gave way through feebleness,
physical and mental, to a stronger,
hardier race from without. In our own
times there seems to loom the same
danger, but the attack comes from
another side. We neither eat nor drink
to such excess as our forefathers, and we
are not grossly luxurious or debauched,
but the strain and the competition of
life, both in professions and in business,
has become so intense that our nervous
systems break down long before their
time. This produces rather a new type
of an old disease. What is this disease
but arterio-sclerosis?—a word which
means only thickening of the arteries,
but which, after fifty, in its far-reaching
results destroys life and working capacity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
far more than cancer or any other disease.
And this disease is, in the great majority
of people, the result of the almost incessant
nervous strain that seldom allows
our hearts and our arteries, and especially
the arteries of our brains, to get their
proper quota of rest.</p>

<p>Though the average duration of life
has increased during the last fifty years,
much of this is due to a lower mortality
in infancy and childhood. There has
been an actual increase in the mortality
rate among males between the ages of
fifty-five and sixty-five. One-third of the
total deaths in this period are due to
diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
In America it is stated to be 10 per cent.
higher. If the causes of death in certificates
were given more exactly, this proportion
would be without doubt still
greater. These deaths cannot be fairly
brought under the heading “Old age.”
This is what we die of! According to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
our death certificates we die of paralysis,
of strokes, of Bright’s disease, of softening
of the brain, of cardiac degeneration, of
angina pectoris, but in nearly every case
the foundation, the <i>causa causans</i> is
arterial disease.</p>

<p>Sir Clifford Allbutt, in his distinctive
way, says:—</p>

<p>“We recognize now, all of us, that,
in the lapse of men’s years, one long
reckoning of his mortality is, and from
all known ages has been, written on the
walls of his vessels. We may suppose
that in the primitive man, by external
conditions if not by innate capacity, life
was of comparatively brief duration.
Domestic animals seem, as a rule, not to
live long enough to use up their arteries
or not to live ill enough to abuse them,
and amongst these creatures atheroma,
though not unknown, has not been commonly
observed. We may reasonably
conjecture that, as in Stable Societies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
human life became protracted, the
arteries got time to wear out.”</p>

<p>There is plenty of evidence from the
mummies of Egypt that atheroma and
sclerosis were common, not only in
advanced age, but in the middle years
of life. We cannot know intimately the
life that these old people lived, but we
can pretty well picture from history both
the height of luxury and the nervous
strain. Civilization brings without doubt
more comfort, more luxury, and more
scientific knowledge, but it seldom brings
more true personal wisdom. The philosophical
calm and contentment with
simple pleasures, and wise simplicity of
life, are still the exception. To use a
slang expression, we are nearly all of
us “on the make,” stretching forth eager
hands and hearts towards the will-o’-the-wisp
of wealth and advancement,
while we let the real values and beauties
of life pass us by and so we continually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
miss our markets. The great war has
taught us one good lesson, viz., that we
can live and be well—nay, better—on
much less food and on simpler than
was our former custom; but it has
increased, at any rate for the present,
the struggle for and the pain of mere
existence.</p>

<p>We must nevertheless be optimistic,
and hope that the great advance in
science may soon make life easier, and
the food of the world once again sufficient
for its inhabitants; then, please God,
materialism may shrink into the background
and things spiritual come into
their own. Not, however, by a reformed
and wiser life alone do I hope to show
the more excellent way, but to show
that modern science has placed in our
hands a preventer of decay and a prolonger
of life and energy. I cannot
promise that this discovery will take
twenty years off a woman’s life and put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
twenty years on to her beauty, but I
know that it will give many more years
of fruitful and enjoyable work, with
greater strength and better health.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">ARTERIO-SCLEROSIS: ITS
NATURE AND ITS CAUSES</p>


<p class="dropcap">The thickening chiefly of the middle
coat of the arteries that we find
in this disease is the first pathological
sign, and it implies that morbid structural
changes have begun; but long
before this occurs, the predisposing causes
have been at work. The actual structural
change is the visible effect of the
law that over-use of a muscle produces
over-growth or hypertrophy. This is not
a law of disease, but of purposeful utility,
designed to meet emergencies of life.
Still there is a further law in nature, that
long-continued excessive use of any
muscle leads to a form of hypertrophy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
which cannot maintain its vitality, but
degenerates. Arteries must be treated
as muscles, for their muscular coats
contract and dilate, as circumstances
demand, under the control of the nervous
system.</p>

<p>Dr. George Oliver, in his third edition
of <i>Studies in Blood Pressure</i>, among his
fundamental data lays down this law:</p>

<p>“Though the left ventricle—dispensing
its blood under a high pressure into
the aorta—is the master hand in maintaining
the arterial blood pressure, the
height to which that pressure rises depends
primarily on the resistance encountered
in the peripheral arterial system, and
in the capillaries, and, secondly, on the
response of the ventricle to overcome
that resistance. Given a normal ventricle
the arterial tonus largely determines the
ventricular response and the level of
the arterial blood pressure; and this
is the keynote of the physiological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
and pathological variations of that
pressure.”</p>

<p>Arterial tension may be described
thus: During the resting-time of the
heart, between each beat, the circulation
of the blood is maintained by the contractile
power of the arteries, which
steadily urges the blood onwards into the
capillary vessels, and so into the veins.
This power is known as arterial tension
or pressure, and it is estimated fairly
accurately by the sphygmomanometer.
A large number of observations have
taught us what is the average pressure
at different ages of life, and thus we
are able to talk about a normal or abnormal
pressure.</p>

<p>If we hope to understand and successfully
treat abnormal pressure and
sclerosis, we must visualize the whole
of this picture clearly, wisely, and in
its due proportions. This we have not
always done. The heart man, as Osler<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
wittily said, “tinkers at the pump,”
while the pressure man, with his manometer,
concentrates on the pipes. To
give a scientific description and explanation
of the physics of the circulation
is far beyond me, and would be inappropriate
in a small practical work of this
sort, but a study of some elaborate
standard work, such as Sir Clifford Allbutt’s
<i>Diseases of the Arteries</i>, or Halliburton’s
<i>Physiology</i>, would do much to give a
fair understanding of this intricate subject:
but, as they so often acknowledge, the
vital problem of the circulation, with
its ever-changing demands, both general
and local, can hardly be solved by the
known laws of physics. Heat and cold,
joy and grief, anger and fear, acting
through the nerves of the vaso-motor
system, all help to complicate the problem
and often to confuse cause and
effect.</p>

<p>As far as we can as yet judge, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
first objective symptom that points to
threatening sclerosis is a more or less
continuous rise of systolic pressure, as
measured by the sphygmomanometer
(the use of this instrument is imperative).
The following extract from the <i>Lancet</i>
January 8, 1916, puts the matter very
clearly: “The clinical value of observations
on Blood Pressure is doubted only
by those who have never made them.
It is true that the finger can detect some
difference in pulse tension, but it is
often entirely at fault, since it can only
estimate total pressure, thus missing a
high pressure, if the volume be small.
In the same way, although the hand can
detect differences of temperature, it
cannot replace the thermometer. The
sphygmomanometer has enlarged our ideas,
cleared up difficulties in diagnosis, and
helped in prognosis. This has naturally
reacted on treatment; it has enlarged
our ideas on ‘heart failure.’ The heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
is adjusted to work at certain pressures,
and though within considerable limits it
can adjust itself to variations, those
limits may be exceeded.”</p>

<p>There are subjective signs, especially
in middle age, which point the same way,
but we can seldom get hold of patients
at this early stage. These are chiefly
shortness of breath, on slight exertion,
which makes a man realize that he has
almost suddenly got out of condition,
that the elasticity of youth has gone;
a feeling of brain fatigue, quite out of proportion
to the work done; sometimes
giddiness and tinnitus, especially on
stooping. Whether these symptoms
appear before there is a rise of pressure
it is difficult to say, but they should
certainly in all cases suggest blood pressure
testing. The key to the patient’s
future then lies first in our hands, and
then in his, life or death, health or disease,
a full working life and happiness or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
incapacity and failure. The examination
must be carefully made and frequently.
The best time to take pressure is about
two hours after food, when there has
been a time of physical quiet, and no
hurry or emotion. The position should
be either recumbent or sitting in a chair,
with the arm resting on a table (the
muscles of the arm should not be in
action), and the wrist should be on the
same level as the heart. Pressure readings
are higher when standing than
sitting, and when sitting than lying down,
the difference being from four to eight
millimetres. In the early stages pressure
varies a good deal, and will not show a
rise at all times of day; in the early
morning particularly it is often quite
normal.</p>

<p>The question now arises, What is the
normal? For our purpose we may leave
out the question of pressures in childhood
and early life, and may take the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
figures as a fair average for our calculation:—</p>

</table>

<p>I think there can be no doubt that
there is a period, often of months, when
there is only increased contraction of
the muscular coats of the arteries. This
is due to the increased strain of life
generally, and is in consonance with our
experience generally of muscular overgrowth
and overwork. Huchard called
this “the pre-sclerotic stage.”</p>

<p>I think we may say that any pressures
at about fifty years of age below 120&#160;mm.
are a sign of debility, and above 150&#160;mm.
are signs of threatening arterial trouble.
Over sixty there is a natural tendency
to hardening of the arteries, and many
men seem to lead healthy lives with a
pressure of 160&#160;mm. Still, with a pressure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
of that height they cannot afford
to put any excessive strain on their
arteries. At about eighty there is a
decided tendency for pressure to fall,
even if there has been plus pressure
before. It is rare to find high pressure
over ninety for the reason that people
who live to that age must have had
healthy hearts and arteries all the time,
but even in them we not infrequently
find passing rises; these are often missed,
but they cause much mental distress
and even delusions, but at this age,
under treatment, the pressure soon falls
and the mind clears. I had one lady
who lived to ninety-seven, and during
the last six years of her life she had
visions and slight delusions when her
pressure rose, but in the intervals her
mind was quite clear. She learned to
recognize the cause of her trouble.</p>

<p>This rule of normality stands pretty
true for the majority of people, but in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
practice we find a good many individual
exceptions: in such, the personal equation
has to be solved. Women often, even
in advanced age, have very low pressures,
even 120&#160;mm. to 125&#160;mm., and seem to
carry on quite well. They again get a
period of high pressure about the climacteric,
which with careful treatment disappears,
and their subsequent years from
about fifty-five to seventy-five are often
the best and the happiest working years
of their lives. It is not uncommon both
in men and women who have led strenuous
but healthy lives to find, about sixty,
steady pressures of 160&#160;mm. to 170&#160;mm.,
without causing any symptoms of illness
or distress. These people, though one
cannot consider them safe lives from
the insurance point of view, have learned
to manage themselves and seem to have
set up a new, personal normal which is
an effective compromise. If one has been
able by careful observation to satisfy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
oneself about such a case, it would
certainly be unwise to try to lower that
pressure point. Even in cases where
there is manifest disease of some standing,
one has to find out the best working
point of pressure for the individual.
They can live and work fairly comfortably
at 160&#160;mm. or 170&#160;mm., but if you lower
the pressure to 140&#160;mm. or 150&#160;mm., their
hearts get irregular and they feel good
for nothing; but I think we may make
a working rule that a pressure of 180&#160;mm.
and over should be lowered; the danger
to the cerebral arteries is too great.
Even in the early stages a careful watch
should be kept on the kidneys. If
albumen appears, it makes the prognosis
more grave, but it should cause no
despair. Mahomed and the early observers
thought that kidney disease was
almost inevitable sooner or later, but
further experience has shown us that
many cases live for years and then die<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
without albuminuria. In other cases it
is often transient and responds to treatment.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have only dealt with systolic
pressure, but the diastolic pressure in
senility and sclerosis is a matter of much
importance, and helps us both in treatment
and prognosis. Brunton said:
“The systolic pressure shows the maximum
height to which blood pressure
is raised by the wave of blood driven
into the aorta by the contraction of the
left ventricle. It thus indicates in a
general way the strength of the ventricle.
The diastolic pressure shows the minimum
to which the blood pressure sinks during
the interval when no blood is coming
into the aorta from the heart, and the
arterial system is emptying itself through
the capillaries into the veins. It therefore
indicates generally the degree of
contraction or relaxation of the capillaries.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>For practical purposes we want to
know the pulse pressure, and this is
roughly estimated by subtracting the
diastolic from the systolic. A systolic
pressure of 140 and a diastolic of 100
would give a pulse pressure of 40, which
is about right. Any pulse pressure of
over 40 points to hyper-tension, and
under 20 to hypo-tension. The diastolic
pressure is more constant than systolic
pressure, and is not so susceptible to
disturbing external influences; it is therefore
a surer guide in estimating hyper-tension.
A continuous diastolic pressure
of over 100 certainly points to continuous
hyper-tension. If the difference between
the systolic and the diastolic is normal,
about 30 to 40, we may conclude that
the heart’s impulse is normal, and that
even in conditions of marked sclerosis
there is efficient compensation.</p>

<p>Sir Clifford Allbutt says (in <i>Diseases
of the Arteries</i>, vol.&#160;i, p.&#160;92): “It is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
the experience of us all that, as the walls
of the great vessels lose their elasticity,
the systolic pressure mounts above its
proportion to the diastolic which falls.
In aortic regurgitation the difference
between the systolic and diastolic figures
may be enormous, as much as 105&#160;mm.
to 210&#160;mm. In a certain ‘Adams
Stokes’ case of my own, at a pulse rate
of 32, the systolic pressure was 180,
the diastolic 90&#160;mm. Thus, with the
difference between the two pressures
waxing as the resilience wanes, the blood
pressure moves more suddenly and largely,
bangs more, and thus racks the machinery.
The greater vaso-motor lability in youth
has a like effect, but the vessels are then
much more resilient and energy is stored.
In an early hyperpietic, or nephritic subject
the systolic exorbitancy may be
considerable or variable, while the diastolic
is steadily in excess. As age advances
the amplitude increases to 80 and upwards;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
a systolic pressure of 160&#160;mm. may be
associated with a diastolic of 75&#160;mm. or
80&#160;mm.”</p>

<p>Dr. H.&#160;C. Mann says: “That as
compensation fails, the diastolic pressure
begins to fall, and the systolic becomes
irregular.” It must seem very difficult
for a beginner, or even for an experienced
busy practitioner, to find his way through
all these devious by-paths, which must
look to him often to be blind alleys and
to lead nowhere, but out of the welter
a few good and sound working principles
emerge.</p>

<p>“<i>Firstly</i>, that at middle age and afterwards
the knowledge of an habitual
systolic pressure is of first-rate importance.</p>

<p>“<i>Secondly</i>, that this knowledge can
be confirmed and sometimes rectified by
knowledge of the diastolic pressure
(manifest valvular diseases of the heart,
especially aortic regurgitation, are excluded);
and that a continuous rise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
of systolic and diastolic pressure point
conclusively to threatening or confirmed
arterio-sclerosis.</p>

<p>“<i>Thirdly</i>, that a steady ratio between
the two pressures, even when much above
normal, is a sign that the heart is doing
its work well; and conversely, a falling
diastolic ratio is a sign of failing compensation.”</p>

<p>Dr. Louis M. Warfield, in his work on
Arterio-Sclerosis, says: “It is most important
to estimate accurately the diastolic
pressure as well as the systolic, for
only in this way can we obtain any data
of value regarding the driving power of
the heart and the condition of the vaso-motor.
A high systolic pressure does not
necessarily mean that a great deal of
blood is forced into the capillaries.
Actually it may mean that very little
blood enters the periphery. The heart
wastes its strength in dilating constricted
vessels without carrying on the circulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
adequately. The pulse pressure is the
difference between the systolic and diastolic
pressure, and practically represents
the heart lode.”</p>

<p>All these considerations demonstrate
the importance of watching closely the
pump as well as the pipes.</p>

<p>In the above figures I am presuming
that the auscultatory method of determining
pressure has been used. It must
also be manifest that, the earlier treatment
begins, the more sure will be the success.
It may be that all our theories will meet
the ultimate fate of so many others and
be abandoned, or partially disproved, but
the practical therapeutic results will
remain—an increased capacity for work
and considerable prolongation of the later
years of life.</p>

<p>For a short and graphic description
of the two methods of estimating pressures
I am poaching from an excellent
book called <i>Blood-pressure Technique<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
Simplified</i>, by Dr. W.&#160;H. Cowing, of
America (pp.&#160;12–15):—</p>

<p>“There are two methods of determining
blood pressure, that by oscillation,
and that by auscultation.</p>

<p>“We will first describe the method
by oscillation.</p>

<p>“Place the bag over the arm with the
two tubes well under the arm and over
the brachial artery. Wrap the remainder
of the sleeve around the arm much the
same as you would apply a bandage,
tucking at least six inches of the sleeve
under the last fold. Then place the
sphygmomanometer in one tube and the
bulb in another, and you are ready
for reading. Care should be taken not
to put the sleeve on tight enough to
cause any apprehensive feeling in the
patient.</p>

<p>“Place the finger lightly over the radial
artery and send the pressure in the cuff
to the point where the pulse has entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
disappeared, then advance the hand
about 2&#160;cm. above this point of disappearance,
then release the air gradually
and note the first perceptible pulse wave
felt by the palpating finger at the wrist.
This represents the true systolic or
maximal pressure.</p>

<p>“Having now obtained the systolic or
maximal pressure, release the air gradually
by means of the escapement valve,
and note where the largest oscillation or
movement of the hand takes place, and
the lowest point of this largest oscillation
is the diastolic or minimal pressure.</p>

<p>“For example, if the largest oscillation
occurred between the divisions 90 to 96,
90, being the lowest, would be the reading.</p>

<p>“It is well to bear in mind to keep
the eye concentrated on the scale divisions,
for the travel of the hand can be accurately
determined when this is done.</p>

<p>“In determining systolic (maximal)
pressure, the pulse becomes more feeble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
as the pressure advances, and when
taken with the ends of the fingers, the
pressure of the fingers is involuntarily
increased, so that a very sensitive pulse
may be closed off entirely by the finger
pressure; while, if taken with the ends
of the fingers resting on the upper curve
of the bone of the wrist, permitting the
balls of the fingers to rest lightly over
the radial, thus bringing in contact with
the pulse the most sensitive part of the
fingers, any extra pressure that might
result would be directed against the bone
and not the pulse.</p>

<p>“<i>Method by Auscultation.</i>—This is by
far the most accurate method of determining
the blood-pressure, and the results
obtained in this way should be free
from error, or the dangers of personal
equation in palpating the artery at the
wrist.</p>

<p>“<i>Systolic or Maximal Pressure.</i>—Bare
the arm and adjust the sleeve well up;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
place the stethoscope over the brachial
artery about 1&#160;cm. below the border of
the cuff, then constrict the arm by
inflating the bag until no sound is heard
in the artery through the stethoscope.
At this point release the air slowly by
means of the escapement valve, and soon
a clear, clicking sound will be heard,
which indicates the first passage of the
blood stream below the constricting arm
band and is the true systolic or maximal
pressure.</p>

<p>“<i>Diastolic or Minimal Pressure.</i>—Still
gradually releasing the air, this clear,
clicking tone (first phase) is followed by
a low tone or murmur (second phase),
and this murmur is followed by a loud,
clear tone (third phase), this in turn by
a perceptibly dull tone (fourth phase),
and this dull tone represents the diastolic
or minimal pressure.</p>

<p>“Below are given the five different
phases of tone to be heard in the auscultatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
blood-pressure phenomena as found
by Louis M. Warfield, A.B., M.D., and
confirmed by his clinical observations on
animals.</p>

<p>“The first phase is due to the sudden
expansion of the collapsed portion of
the artery below the cuff and to the
rapidity of the blood flow. This causes
the first sharp clicking sound which
measures the systolic pressure.</p>

<p>“The second, or murmur and sound
phase is due to the whorls in the blood
stream, as the pressure is further released
and the part of the artery below the
cuff begins to fill with blood.</p>

<p>“The third tone phase is due to the
greater expansion of the artery and to
the lowered velocity in the artery. A
loud tone may be produced by a stiff
artery and a slow stream or by an elastic
artery and a rapid stream. This tone
is clear cut, and in general is louder than
the first phase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>“The fourth phase is a transition from
the third, and becomes duller in sound
as the artery approaches the normal
size.</p>

<p>“The fifth phase, no-sound phase,
occurs when the pressure in the cuff
exerts no compression on the artery and
the vessel is full throughout its length.”</p>

<p>He also says that blood pressure always
depends on four factors, viz.:</p>

<p class="ml1em">
1. Cardiac energy.<br>
2. Peripheral resistance.<br>
3. Elasticity of the arterial walls.<br>
4. The amount of blood in circulation.
</p>

<p>It is very important to remember these
and to give due value to each of them.
With regard to No. 4, it is doubtful if
this is of as much importance as has
been thought or as one would at first
think; the mass of blood in the body
has such a large reserve of stowage room
in the muscles and in the internal viscera,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
that its effect on general arterial pressure
must be slight. The viscosity of this
fluid is probably of far more importance.
If one bleeds a case of high pressure
freely, the pressure will fall, but only
for a short time; the blood is thinned,
but the loss in mass is quickly restored
by absorption from the watery tissues
of the body, and in a very few days the
viscosity returns to its former point.
Bleeding is thus very good for emergencies,
such as threatening apoplexy or cardiac
dyspnœa, but is of little permanent use
in the routine treatment of high pressure.</p>

<p>Sir Clifford Allbutt, wisely and correctly,
I think, divides most examples of abnormal
high pressure into hyperpiesis, which
describes this symptom alone, and into
senile atheroma. Clinically this is important,
for hyperpiesis, which generally
comes on about fifty to sixty, is a very
serious disease, which, untreated, destroys
life in a few years, whereas senile atheroma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
may go on till advanced old age, crippling
energy perhaps, but in many cases hardly
shortening life at all. The former generally
ends in cerebral hæmorrhage, cardiac
degeneration or Bright’s disease, but senile
atheroma may escape all of these. In
hyperpiesis raised pressure is continuous
and tends steadily to increase; in
atheroma there are times of high pressure,
but as the disease advances the
pressure is often normal or subnormal, its
gravity depending much on the seat of
the atheroma.</p>

<p>Are we justified in regarding arterio-sclerosis
as a true disease? I think not.
One cannot justly compare it with entity
diseases, such as the acute infections, as
cancer, as tuberculosis, or the diseases
that affect the brain and the spinal cord.
It is, I think, one of the penalties of
an artificial over-civilization, of social,
business and competitive pressure, unwise
in quantity and unscientific in method.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
Unfitted, as yet, in development, and
lacking the necessary knowledge, men
strive after a higher stage of evolution,
or after illusions which they think to
be so. For a while they seem to succeed,
but involution and premature degeneration
are the inevitable consequences. To
attain their “ambitious” ends they live
and work intensely, stoking their furnaces
with far too much food, alcohol and other
unnatural stimulants. Intemperate in
work, intemperate in living, prodigal in
waste, they come to an untimely end.</p>

<p>Such is the description of one type
of case that we often meet, but there
is another and a sadder class, where
unfavourable circumstances through the
greater part of life, pressure of poverty
and ceaseless anxiety for others, produce
a careworn existence, with no joy or
colour in it, and often insomnia. Such
as these, in spite of a sober, abstemious
life, often get sclerosis. Their pulses are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
small and thready, but hard, and often
deceive the finger. Paralysis from small
cerebral hæmorrhage is the frequent end.
We may take it as an axiom that happiness
lowers pressure, while grief and care
raise it. We must all of us feel this as
a personal truth, though we may not
be able to test it with a manometer. It
is not only the cat that care kills. In
melancholia the pressure is almost always
well above normal; in maniacal conditions
generally below.</p>

<p>Few of us know how to work with our
brains; psychology has as yet taught
us but little of method and of practical
value, though for this we must blame
ourselves rather than the psychologists.
We drive our conscious minds with few
or no intervals of rest till brain exhaustion
comes; then the machinery gets out
of control and the screw races; so come
insomnia and poor, confused results, with
disappointment and depression. We talk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
glibly about the sub-conscious mind, and
are now and again struck with some
evidence of its working existence, but
we few of us use it systematically as our
servant—the most competent servant that
exists, and one that never gives notice
as long as life lasts. Our upper story,
in which we suppose our conscious-thought
machine works, is like a loft full of noisy
machinery that often needs oiling and
that often gets out of order. Its physical
motor power gets slack or runs right
down, and the output is poor or ceases.
Sleep and rest alone will restore it and
set it going again.</p>

<p>Our sub-conscious mind seems to be
almost independent of our physical life;
it works more or less continuously while
the conscious mind is working, fooling
or sleeping. To continue the loft simile:
beneath the machine loft, with its clatter
and dust, is a quiet darkened room,
in which our sub-conscious mind lives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
and functions in its own quiet way.
Men who know how to use it say that,
when their conscious minds become exhausted
and have come to an impasse,
all they have to do is to open the trapdoor
and pass the apparently insoluble
problem down into the quiet room below.
They then banish the subject from their
minds completely, rest, play, or take
up some other line of thought, and by
and by, in a day or two perhaps, when
they are not thinking of it, the problem
turns up solved. There is no sense of
fatigue or of conscious effort in this
process: it is just the old adage of
sleeping over a difficulty. Many of the
world’s great inventors have, knowingly
or sometimes unknowingly, made their
great discoveries in this way. Our conscious
minds are limited in motive power
and always subject to fatigue, but our
sub-conscious minds rarely tire and are
unlimited in scope and power, for they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
are a part of our Divine inheritance, a
portion of the great undivided spiritual
force that moves and governs the universe,
that slumbers not nor sleeps. To get
into close touch with this power needs
persevering practice, but it is clearly of
inestimable value. We must not expect
a clear and useful response unless we
have given concentrated attention to the
matter in point; a mass of ill-digested,
uncertain data will remain as such; we
must be perfectly honest with our <i>alter
ego</i>; it is of no use trying to take him
in. The more often and thoroughly we
accustom what we call ourselves and our
sub-conscious minds to work together in
a friendly way, the better and the quicker
will be the response.</p>

<p>The above is only a cursory sketch of
a profound subject, but will serve to
show what great economies can be made
in the working of our limited human
understandings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p>The condition of our arteries that we
call sclerosis is much more common in
the sedentary brain-worker than it is
in the outdoor man. We see it rarely
in the farmer, the sailor, the labourer,
unless it is as the result of habitual
intemperance; we see it rarely in the
athlete. The average blood-pressure of
the indoor worker is certainly higher
than that of the open-air worker, even
in perfect health.</p>

<p>It follows, therefore, that the more we
systematize and economize in our brain
work, the less the strain on the arteries
that supply that organ with its life-blood.
Few of us realize what can be done
in this direction. A much advertised
system, which I need not further particularize,
has got hold of some of the right
ideas and methods, and its teaching will
have a big effect in many directions.
It is no new system; like almost all
wisdom, it comes from the East. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
old Hindu and Persian philosophers knew
and practised it thousands of years ago,
and got results which we have not approached
as yet. The foundation is
concentrated attention: we talk about
giving attention to a thing, but we most
of us do it in a very perfunctory, superficial
way. Kipling’s <i>Kim</i>, which is full
of old, out-of-the-way, unsuspected
philosophy, gives us a wonderful picture
of concentrated attention in the contest
of observation and memory between Kim
and the native boy in Lurgan Sahib’s
shop. We talk admiringly of a man
with “singleness of purpose,” but what
is that but concentrated attention? We
admire him because he achieves his
object, he gets there, while the ordinary
man with half-a-dozen half-concentrated
purposes wanders down all sorts of side
ways and seldom arrives anywhere. In
this world of keen competition and of
little leisure, waste of brain-power leads inevitably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
towards disease and failure, while
economy leads to health and attainment.</p>

<p>Beyond the question of the nature of
our mental work lies the thing worked
for—the object: the importance of this
from the health and disease standpoint
is very great. If the object is a worthy
one, something of use, something elevating,
not only for ourselves but for others,
attainment will bring happiness and peace,
and so tend towards a healthy condition
of brain. If, on the other hand, we
strive for an ignoble, selfish object, one
that is almost certain to harm others,
attainment will be like Dead Sea fruit
in our mouths, dry and unsatisfying;
there will be in us no sense of joy, and
the injury we have done to others will
recoil on ourselves, bringing disappointment
and sorrow. These are they who
walk in slippery places, while the unthinking
world, seeing not their end, regards
them with envy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>By learning to use our minds wisely,
intelligently and economically, we shall
accomplish far more and with far less
expenditure of force; we shall grow in
the true philosophical love of a high
and simple life. The false aims, the
conflicts, the disharmonies of this world
will pass us by and leave us at peace.</p>

<p>Arterio-sclerosis, then, except in the
sad cases of heredity, is very much of
our own making; it almost comes under
the heading of “an occupation disease”;
it is a natural result of non-natural
conditions of life. In the words of Isaiah:
“Wherefore do ye spend money for that
which is not bread, and your labour
for that which satisfieth not?”</p>

<p>Writers have for descriptive purposes,
and in most cases rightly, divided arterio-sclerosis
into the two main types that
I have described on p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_50">50</a>—the hyperpiesis
type and the atheromatous; but
in general everyday practice we shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
often come across cases that fall under
neither head. Raised blood pressure, even
to a considerable degree, 170&#160;mm. to
180&#160;mm., is frequently a temporary affair
only, brought about by temporary causes,
such as grief, anger, excitement or injudicious
feeding. An altered mental outlook
or a dose of calomel may banish
it quickly; these cases are functional
only. The wiser ones get to recognize
their symptoms and the causes: these
symptoms are chiefly a worried state of
mind, irritability about little things, a
sense of brain hurry, without the power
to accomplish, and there may be passing
vertigo and tinnitus. Such is the day of
small things which should never be
ignored, for the day of small errors unheeded
may pass on into the long night
of disease.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE WAY OF SAFETY</p>


<p>The pre-sclerotic state of raised pressure
may last a considerable time—two
or three years—but this can never
be relied upon; every attack means extra
work for the heart, and uses up for a
time the reserve power of that long-suffering
organ. Some hearts will respond
well to the call for many years, but
others give out and dilate. Continued
raised pressure means one of two things—increased
resistance and partial obstruction
in the small arteries and capillaries,
or increased ventricular action and force.
An example of the first, which is far the
more common, is seen in sclerosis; of
the second, in aortic regurgitation. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
one case the heart is overcoming resistance—in
the other, compensating for a
leak. In the first, the error or departure
from the normal is in the pipes—in the
second, in the pump; but as both are
vital organs and not mere bits of mechanism,
they in time react on each other
and both become altered. This change is,
if vitality be strong, in the direction of
conservatism, of accommodation to the
new order of things. It is compromise,
which may be effectual for a long time,
but which, like most compromises, comes
to failure in the end. Occasionally we
find the sclerosis attacking the heart muscle
itself or its arteries; such cases
are obviously more serious. This condition
generally comes on more or less at
the end of the disease, but in a few cases
quite early. Probably many of the cases
of true angina pectoris occurring in early
middle life are of this nature, the coronaries
being the chief point of attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>Besides excess of work and unwise work
there is another cause which seems to
raise pressure, and that is absorption of
ptomaines or of the products of imperfect
digestion; the overstrain cause and the
absorption cause very often act concurrently,
for imperfect assimilation is often
the result of the unwise life. We see
this more often, perhaps, where the unwise
life is accompanied by overeating
and injudicious alcoholic stimulation, even
if this is not very excessive: such people
rarely give themselves time to digest. The
supply of nerve energy that is necessary
for perfect digestion is turned off at the
main long before its proper time. We
doctors have a first-hand personal knowledge
of this cause, for owing partly to
the intensive nature of our work and
partly to the exigeant importunity of
our patients, we more often practise the
vices we deplore than the virtues we
praise; this is one of the reasons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
that our profession is the shortest-lived
of all.</p>

<p>It is not quite clear how this absorption
causes hypertension, but it is probably
through an effect on endocrine glands,
chiefly perhaps on the suprarenal and
secondly on the thyroid. McGarrison has
shown how often Graves’ disease is caused
by faulty intestinal digestion, and by the
colitis that ensues; this he thinks stimulates
the thyroid to overactivity or to
faulty secretion. The suprarenals are
probably affected still more than the
thyroid, and the hyperthyroidism may
be due to the upset of the balance of
power; for these two glands through the
sympathetic act and react on one another.
It is fairly established that in some cases
of Graves’ disease we get hypertension
and in some hypotension, though both
conditions vary a good deal. It may be
that the hypotension cases are those that
are accompanied by suprarenal deficiency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
and that benefit by suprarenal treatment,
and I believe it to be so. This would
explain the conflicting opinions as to the
value of this treatment. It has certainly
succeeded admirably in some cases.</p>

<p>The co-ordination of all endocrine
actions is so intricate that we can only
puzzle out the way by careful clinical
observation and experiment. In sclerosis,
as a rule, we get evidence of hyperadrenalism
and more certainly of hypothyroidism.
Victor Horsley considered
premature senility to be a form of
myxœdema, which of course means pronounced
hypothyroidism.</p>

<p>Biedl says: “A special pathogenetic
significance is ascribed to thyroid insuffiency
in the changes which occur in later
life, and which are included in the term
‘cachexia of old age,’ or senile degeneration.
The foundation for the theory that
old age results from the changes in the
thyroid gland lies in the fact that in old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
age the thyroid becomes atrophied, its
follicles shrink, and retrogressive changes
take place in the epithelial cells. This
is reinforced by the fact that there is a
profound analogy between the signs of
advanced old age and myxœdema. The
falling of the hair and the dropping out
of the teeth, the dry and wrinkled skin,
the lowered temperature, the diminished
perspiration, the indolent digestion and
consequent emaciation, the decrease of
mental power and the diminution of the
activity of the entire nervous system—these
are all symptoms that characterize
chronic myxœdema.”</p>

<p>From the old partially true adage, that
a man is as old as his arteries, we must
go a step further back and say that a man
is as old as his thyroid. This statement
is probably not a final one, but it gives
us a very valuable pointer in the way of
treatment. Arterio-sclerosis and arterial
degeneration are the almost universal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
accompaniments of thyroid deficiency,
and are in most cases the result of
that condition.</p>

<p>There is no main or royal road to the
successful management of sclerosis; every
little cause must be thought out and
righted if possible, but as a foundation
nothing is so important, I think, as a clean,
healthy intestine, which hitherto has been
much neglected. A microscopical examination
of the fæces will often show what
is wrong, and also the direction and
results of treatment.</p>

<p>If the condition is thoroughly bad I
begin with this rather drastic regime—twenty-four
hours’ absolute starvation in
bed, a tenth of a grain of calomel every
hour for twelve hours and as much hot
water as the patient can comfortably
drink. This has a wonderful effect, and
one’s subjective feelings after it tell us
that evil has gone out of us and that
good has taken its place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>The treatment by bowel antiseptics has
been generally very unsatisfactory. Beta
naphthol helps, perhaps, but the most
good comes from duodenal extract in
some form. Two grains of the dried
powder about two hours after each meal
in pill or tablet act well. Carnrick’s
Secretogen tablets and the much-advertized
Jubol are good, and both depend
on some extract from the duodenal
mucosa. The unpleasant flatulence and
the fermentation in the bowel soon disappear,
and with them the mucus that
is often shed from the coats of the colon.
Better assimilation of food goes hand-in-hand
with improved health and vigour.
Intestinal dyspepsia is more far-reaching
in its effects than gastric dyspepsia, but
is often ignored.</p>

<p>The questions of food and cooking need
most careful consideration. In the affairs
of the soul Christ taught “that which
cometh out of the man, that defileth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
the man”; in the affairs of the body,
that which goeth into a man, that defileth
the man. Both teachings are true and
both are purposeful exaggerations and in
a sense untrue. Out of the same mouth
proceed blessings and cursings and into
the same mouth go good food and poisons.
The sin lies sometimes in the nature, but
more often perhaps in the excess. The
word “temperance” has been made to
apply far too much to the use of alcohol.
As a fact, I believe, far more nowadays
are intemperate in eating than in drinking.
As the tale of our years increases and as
our physical life gets less strenuous and
active, we require less food, or at any
rate a different kind of food; the strong
nitrogenous foods, as meat, become less
called for, and if taken beyond our needs
become poisons. The imperfect products
of assimilation have to be dealt with by
our excretory organs, which become overworked
and unable to meet the demands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
The scavengers cannot clear the dust-heaps.
Hence arise kidney disease, faulty
liver action, and raised blood pressure.
And yet, how many of us seek to restore
failing strength by stronger food and
more stimulation? In this futility, kind
but ignorant friends aid and abet. Think
on what a little food a baby lives and
grows, and, at the other end of life, on
what a simple frugal diet really old people
thrive and work.</p>

<p>It is all very well to lay down rules for
food, calculated in calories for strong
working men and athletes, but in approaching
old age every one must become
more or less a lawgiver to himself; this
especially, if there is any tendency to
hyperpiesis, for any food in excess of the
body’s needs becomes for the time a
poison. What we can digest easily and
what with difficulty must be largely a
personal question, but the direction should
certainly be towards a non-meat regime.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
The difference of climate makes comparison
between the vegetable feeders of
the tropics and ourselves of uncertain
value, but it is a lesson to see what the
Scotch gillie can do on a diet that is
mostly oatmeal, milk and cheese. The
gluttonous man and the wine bibber seem
to get a pleasure out of life that the
sober men miss, but we doctors see the
other side of the shield, the after-suffering
and the failure: the broken law brings its
own punishment and there is no escape.</p>

<p>The physiological process of digestion
is rather elaborate, and, fortunately for
us, somewhat elastic. It is not a question
entirely of certain substances in a test-tube
exposed to certain digestive agents.
This, of course, is the foundation, the
basic process, but there is much variation
in the nature of the food, in the external
conditions of season, of heat and cold, of
youth and age, of greater or less physical
or mental demands on the food digested,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
and lastly on the supplies of saliva, of
pepsin, of hydrochloric acid and of duodenal
and pancreatic secretions. These
are all under the control of the autonomous
nervous system, which in the stresses of
life often breaks down and fails to function
properly. In the full tide of youthful
energy our digestions seem to respond
effectually to many and unreasonable
demands, but this is more apparent than
real; the bills may be a long time before
they are sent in, but they come. The
recuperative power of youth is marvellous,
but probably never quite complete. After
forty years of age it fails more and more,
and then bills come in more quickly,
while in old age it becomes almost a
question of cash on delivery. Realizing
this we should, in our own interests,
treat our digestive apparatus with deep
respect, and not with the scant courtesy
we generally show, for on its faithful
working depend our life, our health, our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
happiness and our powers of work. The
farmer in his feeding of cattle, the head
of a racing stable in his feeding and
training of horses is far more scientific
and wise than we and most other men
are in the management of ourselves. This
is why we end our days so often prematurely,
or in paralysis and pain.</p>

<p>To go into actual details of diet is a
thankless task, and not very helpful to
the mass of men; it is better, I think,
to point out directions only. If there
are symptoms of hyperpiesis, the chief
object is to arrange a diet that contains
a minimum of protein (especially of animal
protein) compatible with life and energy.
Most of such cases are leading a life of
no great physical strain and will do well
on a diet calculated in calories, that
contains:</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p>If this is insufficient, add to the fat or
carbohydrate rather than to the protein.</p>

<p>The following tables from Dr. Sprigg’s
excellent work classify the common foods
according as their energy production is
due to protein, carbohydrate or fat. It
will be noticed that milk is the only food
in the lists which contains a good proportion
of all three. Cheese, Brazil nuts
and bread contain a fair proportion of at
least two of the requisite food-stuffs.</p>

<p>If we take, for instance, the figures of
lean beef in the first and second column,
viz.:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="wid300">

<p>But the chemical side of the problem is not the only one to study.
Idiosyncrasy, appetite for certain foods,
distaste for others, and personal experience
must all receive due consideration. The
appetite for certain foods varies much
at different periods of life. Fat is abhorrent
to many children, and their lives
and digestions are much troubled by
the parental, but unscientific order to
“clear up their plates.” In later years
the same persons will welcome fat and
need it. Sugar again is loved by children,
scorned in middle age, when its place is
often supplied by wine or beer, and is
again welcomed and of great value in
old age, for it helps much to maintain
the failing heat of the body, to keep
the home fires burning. Good cane-sugar
at all stages of life seems to act as a special
food, or at any rate stimulant, to the
heart muscle; given in large quantities it
often gives a failing heart a new lease
of life. The digestibility of food is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
governed entirely by its chemical composition.
Twice cooked meat must contain
nearly as much potential nourishment
as once cooked, but experience tells most
of us that we digest it with difficulty;
and if the digestion of a food is not
perfect, there is more unwholesome waste
product to be cleared away; there is
impure blood circulating in all our organs,
but we feel it perhaps more in our brains;
the lethargy, the depression, the irritability
that we all recognize as the accompaniments
of indigestion, all stand as
cause and effect. Again hot fat and
cold fat must contain the same constituents,
but many can do well with
cold fat, while they get bilious with the
other. The same thing applies to butter.
All these things we must honestly observe,
each man for himself, and we must not
let our likes and our appetites, nor our
prejudices, sway the conclusions of personal
experience and scientific knowledge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Dr. Haig has shown us how many of our
ailments are connected with excess of
uric acid in the blood, and how much
this excess is due to certain foods such as
meat, which contains what Fischer named
purine bodies. The following extract from
Halliburton’s <i>Handbook of Physiology</i> will
partially explain this subject:</p>

<p><b>Origin of Uric Acid.</b>—Uric acid is
not made by the kidneys; when these
organs are removed, uric acid continues
to be formed, and accumulates in the
organs, especially in the liver and spleen.
After extirpation of the liver in birds
(in which animals uric acid is such an
important katabolite) the formation of
uric acid practically ceases, and its place
is taken by ammonia and lactic acid,
and the conclusion is therefore drawn
that in these animals ammonia and lactic
acid are normally synthesized in the liver
to form uric acid. But in mammals this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
is not the history of uric acid formation;
in these animals, including man, uric acid
is the end-product of the metabolism of
nuclein, from the bases of which it arises
by oxidization. Nuclein, the main constituent
of the nuclei of cells, yields on
decomposition certain products called
purine substances, and their close relationship
to uric acid is shown by their
formulæ:</p>

<p>“Just as the ordinary protein metabolism
is both exogenous and endogenous,
so is it the case with nuclein metabolism.
There are certain kinds of food (such as
liver and sweetbread) which are rich in
nuclei, and others, such as meat, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
are rich in purine bases (especially
hypoxanthine). The increase in uric acid
excretion after partaking of such food is
exogenous, and those liable to uric acid
disorders should avoid such articles of
diet. Other forms of diet lead to an
increase of uric acid formation by increasing
the number of leucocytes in the
blood, and there is a consequent increase
in the metabolism of their nuclei.
Increase in leucocytes may, however, be
present independently of diet, and in
the disease known as leucocythæmia this
occurs to a marked degree; in such cases
uric acid formation increases. Although
special attention has been directed to
the nuclei of leucocytes, because these
can be readily examined during life, it
must be remembered that the nuclein
metabolism of all cells may contribute
to uric acid formation. Uric acid, which
originates by metabolism, is spoken of
as endogenous.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>
<p>These purine bodies taken in excess, it
is almost certain, tend to raise blood-pressure
and to favour the production of
gout and arterio-sclerosis. Much can be
done, when these threaten, by reducing
the amount of these in our food. There
is, except in very extreme cases, no need
for an absolute purine-free diet, but the
diet should be in that direction and so
towards a sensible, liberal vegetarianism.
The following table of ordinary foods,
showing the purine contents in grains per
pound, pint or teacup, is from the <i>Lancet</i>,
1906, vol.&#160;ii, p.&#160;933, Potts:</p>

<p>In sclerosis perhaps the chief thing is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
to avoid the flesh extracts, such as beef-tea,
strong meat soups, and rich gravies;
for this reason boiled or stewed meats
are better than fried or roast. This applies
to fish and chicken also; a plain grill is
good, but the frying-pan is a danger.
Vegetable soups made with bone stock
may be taken. Cheese, eggs and milk
should supply the greater part of the
nitrogenous or protein food. The better
sorts of vegetable foods, such as oatmeal,
lentils, peas and nuts, will all help to take
the place of albuminous animal foods.
A certain amount of fat should be
taken. A fish and chicken diet contains
too little fat and should be
perfected by bacon, hot or cold. All
the farinaceous foods are good, but
the more starchy ones, such as sago,
rice and cornflour, are with some people
more liable to cause fermentative
dyspepsia.</p>

<p>As age advances and our teeth fail in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
power we are apt to slip into the way of
eating chiefly soft, well-cooked foods, in
which what are known as vitamines are
almost destroyed, but they are as essential
as ever, and some uncooked fruit, salads
and unboiled milk should enter into our
diet.</p>

<p>When one thinks over the luxurious
habits of our predecessors, the enormous
amount of food, in excess of body needs,
taken at big dinners, one must realize
how we and they sinned against the light.
The great war has taught most of us,
with the exception perhaps of the new
rich, how little we can live on and work
on with complete efficiency. Economy of
food, simplicity of life, mean economy of
waste and of expenditure of vital force,
and our bitter war experiences should
prove to be the path to longer lives, and
to lives with a higher standard and greater
results.</p>

<p>The question of alcohol in sclerosis is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
difficult, but very important. In the first
place it depends somewhat on what a
man has been accustomed to take. If
he has taken a moderate amount with his
food during the greater part of his life
it does not always do to stop it. Alcohol
is not a pressure raiser, as many think,
but rather the reverse, and, if stopped
suddenly, the digestive powers may be
lessened and the tone of the body
depressed. Lauder Brunton says: “All
the Alcohols tend to dilate vessels,
to diminish blood-pressure, and ultimately
to diminish activity of the
nervous tissues, although at first sight
they may seem to have a stimulant
action.”</p>

<p>Alcohol contains so little nutritious food
(with the exception of the sugars and
extractives of wine and beers) that in
itself it may be said to give nothing to
the body; but there is something a bit
beyond this—the bitter of the hop and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
flavour, the bouquet of the grape have a
stimulating effect on the nerves of taste
and smell, and so produce, with some
people, a better flow of saliva and gastric
juice. This probably is how wine and
beer in moderate quantities help digestion
and appetite. There is still further the
effect on the general nervous system.
Alcohol without doubt enables a man to
draw on his reserve of force, though it
probably does not increase those reserves.
This is, of course, drawing on one’s capital,
but the ability to do this may be of great
use in emergencies, for it can help a man
to live over evil times. But it must not
be forgotten that such calls, if too large
or often repeated, must in the end empty
the reservoirs and leave him powerless and
defenceless.</p>

<p>This question of alcohol must be regarded
by physicians with common sense backed
by scientific knowledge. The world is
never going to be cured of alcoholic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
intemperance by intemperance in language
and inaccuracy in thought.</p>

<p>Before I go into the more detailed
treatment of sclerosis, I must just touch
on the question of tobacco. Nicotine,
without doubt, is one of the most powerful
raisers of arterial pressure known, but in
ordinary smoking very little gets into the
system. Tobacco chewing and snuff-taking,
both nearly extinct, probably
introduce more nicotine into the body.
The combustion in cigar smoking is so
nearly complete that very little poison
remains except on the lips. In ordinary
cigarette smoking the combustion is about
as complete as in the case of cigars, but,
if the smoke is habitually inhaled, the
absorption through the bronchial mucous
membrane is much greater and, I think,
must have an appreciable effect on blood-pressure.
As in alcohol, so in tobacco,
we must not lose sight of the effect on
the general nervous system: on many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
people tobacco, in moderation, has a distinctly
soothing influence, and so leads to
a quietude of mind which compensates
for any other small evil effect. Used in
excess, it certainly weakens both nerve
and will power, and often heart power.
The first effect in experimental nicotine
poisoning is greatly raised blood pressure,
but at the end dangerously low pressure,
and so we find that the ultimate effect of
excessive smoking is a feeble, low-tension
pulse that is often irregular. Oliver found
that, in ordinary people who were not
excessive smokers, tobacco raised the
systolic pressure 10 to 15&#160;mm., but that
the diastolic was unaffected; the variations
between the two thus becoming
abnormal. This effect generally subsides
in a quarter of an hour after smoking
is finished.</p>

<p>It follows, I think, that a man with
sclerosis should think this out for himself,
for he is not in a position to take any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
unnecessary chances. Of another of our
daily habits, it is wise to remember that
coffee raises pressure more than tea, and
China tea less than Indian.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that an indoor,
sedentary life tends to high pressure far
more than an active, outdoor one. This
is partly due to the mental work and
concentration that goes with it and partly
to oxygen deficiency. The inhalation of
oxygen lessens the viscosity of the blood
and consequently the work of the heart
and of the arterial muscles, while an
excess of carbon-dioxide in the air increases
the viscosity and the necessary heart
force that must be expended. The amount
of oxygen we inhale in the open is necessarily
more than in confined buildings,
and we all feel how difficult it is to drive
our brains in a close, stuffy atmosphere.
This points to the economic value of
ventilation and space. Wise, moderate
exercise also tends to lower pressure by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
promoting a general quickening of circulation
throughout the whole body; the
stagnant pools are flushed out and
oxygenation becomes more perfect. Even
severe exercise in health only raises pressure
temporarily; the subsequent level in
health is below the original. But where
there is evidence of cardio and arterial
disease, exercise must be taken wisely,
moderately, and only slowly increased.
This is done very effectually in some
health resorts, where the patient is trained
to mount gradually increasing slopes. The
same effect is reached by graduated exercises.
In all these methods pulse rate
and arterial pressure are tested and serve
as guides to further advance. Certain
Bath treatments, such as Nauheim and
its English adaptations, help materially
to lower pressure and to hasten a sluggish
blood flow. These act chiefly by dilating
the blood-vessels at the surface of the
whole body and thus relieving internal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
congestions and increasing oxygen exchange.</p>

<p>The nature of our games and exercise
in sclerosis needs careful thought. Golf,
for instance, is very good if taken quietly,
but some courses are so hilly that there
is a good deal of strain put on the heart.
If one is compelled to play on such a
course, one must take it slowly, and not
allow the spirit of the game to run away
with one. Quiet sculling is one of the
best exercises, for it works all the muscles
of the body slowly and symmetrically, and
the strain on heart and lungs is entirely
under one’s own control. Swimming,
again, is a most healthy exercise, if taken
quietly and not in very cold water. I
know of nothing that improves one’s
wind so quickly. But all these exercises
must be taken under advice and never
pushed to the point of real fatigue or
exhaustion.</p>

<p>The need of rest is as great as the need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
of the right sort of exercise. Late hours
should be absolutely avoided and little
brain work should be done in the evening,
so that the brain and all its important
arteries can sink into relaxation and sleep
at once. The rest to the heart and
circulation is of course never so prolonged,
but nature has designed them to get
their rest only in moments. The heart
in an adult rests more than thirteen
hours out of the twenty-four, under quiet
normal conditions, the time of rest being
the diastole, and the time of work being
the systole or contraction. There are
few healthy men who could not walk a
thousand miles in six weeks, walking
about eight hours a day and resting for
the remainder of their time; but there
are not many men who could walk a
thousand miles in a thousand consecutive
hours, as the late Captain Barclay did,
because the frequent interruptions to their
sleep would exhaust them completely.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
In the same way, if the heart is forced to
beat more quickly, it becomes sooner
exhausted, for the extra work is taken
from the diastole, the sleeping or resting
time of the heart.</p>

<p>The blood pressure is generally ten
degrees lower in the morning after a good
night’s rest; and for this reason, in severe
cases, I often advise people to take a
whole day in bed once a week, so that
this lower pressure may be prolonged for
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The non-medicinal treatment of sclerosis,
prophylactic and curative, consists
then chiefly in a philosophical, calm mode
of life, in a firm restraint of passions,
of worry and excitements, in a wise and
economic use of brain power, in great
moderation in eating and drinking, in
giving as much of our time as is possible
to fresh air and moderate, unhurried
exercise, and lastly to the avoidance of
all severe strains on mind or body. Very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
few of us are able to accomplish all these
positive and negative virtues, but as far
as in us lies, they should be our rule of
life.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE MEDICINAL TREATMENT OF
SCLEROSIS</p>


<p>The question now arises, what
can the Physician, by real
therapeutics, do to help? Much, I
feel sure, if he will carefully and
courageously apply the knowledge that
has come to us of the late years.
Firstly, Lauder Brunton showed us
how we can quickly reduce the blood
pressure that is one of the chief
symptoms in angina pectoris, the
immediate effect of amyl nitrite in
reducing arterial tension, and the slower
but very valuable effects of nitroglycerin
and the other nitrites. This
has enabled us to meet many an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
emergency, but the effects of these
are not sustained enough to become a
steady daily treatment. The orthodox
remedy has been for years Iodide of
Potassium; this has been by the
teachers of the past so driven into us
that, in spite of failures that far outweigh
the successes, it has become
heterodox to doubt it. Yet one must
confess that one has been for years
prescribing it more from a sense of
duty than from any confident hope of
its results. In a few cases, where there
is cardiac pain and symptoms of new or
chronic aortitis, it certainly does good,
but in the average case of hyperpiesis
it is a very poor reed to trust.</p>

<p>How does Iodide act? Chiefly, in
all probability, by stimulating the
thyroid to pour more of its secretion
into the blood stream. Thus is produced
the absorption of gummata,
of new lowly formed tissues and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
thickenings of fibrositis and rheumatism.
We see the same result more
decidedly and more constantly in the
treatment of myxœdema by thyroid
feeding.</p>

<p>As I have shown before, senile degeneration,
premature and normal, is
largely due to general endocrine degeneration
and deficiency, and it has many
relations to myxœdema. Thyroid deficiency
as a rule means raised blood
pressure, and, as has been shown in
young animals deprived of their thyroids,
a strong tendency to get atheromatous
disease of the large arteries,
even in youth.</p>

<p>The parallels are many, and so are
the lessons they convey. If one had
a perfectly functioning thyroid in arterio-sclerosis,
one might with some confidence
treat it by Iodides; but as we know
that such is not the condition in the
great majority of cases, we should expect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
to fail. One would have to give Iodide
in enormous quantities with any hope
to whip up a senile thyroid into effectual
activity, and then in all probability
fail. (This may be the explanation of
the miracles worked by big doses of
Iodide in syphilitic gummata in the
brain, but in these cases there is rarely
evidence of thyroid deficiency.)</p>

<p>Why then do we take the long and
disagreeable route to our object by
giving Iodide? Thyroid feeding acts
here just as it does in myxœdema.
We have to take into consideration the
comparative failure of the other endocrine
glands, but that only adds to the
charm and attractiveness of the problem.
The suprarenal and the pituitary
are the most important, but one
must not neglect the sexual glands. I
feel strongly that thyroid treatment
alone or in combination is the rational
method to adopt in sclerosis: personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
experience confirms this every day.
We purposely side-track the worn-out
thyroid of sclerosis and senility, and,
by thyroid feeding, restore to a great
extent the whole endocrine harmony,
thus giving a new tone and stimulus
to existence. We shall have to use more
or less thyroid feeding for the remainder
of life, but we must show our patients
that it is not a medicine but a necessary
food. As in myxœdema, so in sclerosis,
thyroid feeding is the only means, as
yet known, of producing absorption of
those thickenings that characterize
both diseases.</p>

<p>I have had lately the opportunity of
watching and treating a thorough case
of myxœdema in a lady about forty
years of age, a very intelligent and
educated woman. She weighs her
symptoms and knows exactly when
she needs more or less thyroid; she
judges by her head feelings, vertigo, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
sense of fatigue, etc., and by her hair
falling out. But thyroid in sufficient
doses produces a quick, irritable heart
action; this she can quiet by taking
suprarenal extract. Under sufficient
thyroid her blood pressure comes down
to normal and the suprarenal does not
raise it. With this balanced combination
she can lead a useful and enjoyable
life. The same thing happens more or
less in later life, where there is high
pressure and other signs of arterial thickening.</p>

<p>Suprarenal by the mouth seems to
me to have the power of raising low
pressures to the normal—a most valuable
property in the asthenia of pneumonia
and diphtheria—but there comes
in some check action which prevents
its causing hypertension.</p>

<p>Dr. Sajous, the well-known scientific
physician of America, at the annual
meeting of the American Therapeutic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
Society in May 1920, said: “With
regard to the adrenals, in his opinion,
clinical experience with the human
subject did not bear out the statements
of physiologists that therapeutic doses
of adrenalin had any inhibitory effects
on the functions of the gastro-intestinal
canal; in fact, the effect was quite
the opposite. The supposed blood-pressure
raising power of adrenalin also
proved misleading; indeed, one of his
workers found that, if there was one
thing that adrenalin did not do, it was
to raise blood pressure.”</p>

<p>In this direction we must realize the
wonderful selective action of adrenalin,
that of dilating the coronary arteries,
contracting the arteries and arterioles
of the skin and of the great splanchnic
area and of dilating the deep arteries
of the limbs. These selective actions
explain the great relief it gives in asthma
and acute respiratory distress, such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
œdema of the lungs, where it bleeds
a man into his own distal vessels.</p>

<p>The absence of raised pressure in the
brachial and radial arteries may be thus
explained also. Again we must not
forget that there may be, and probably
is, something in the extract of the whole
gland besides adrenalin. Administered
by stomach the extract has, I think,
far more effect than pure adrenalin given
in the same way, and more lasting.
Given by rectum, adrenalin acts quickly
and powerfully. In France thyroid
treatment is sometimes carried out by
injections of an extract of the whole
gland subcutaneously, but it is difficult
to get an extract that is stable.</p>

<p>In persons of middle age it is far more
common to get the unpleasant heart
effects of thyroid than in really old
people, but it is not by any means an
absolute rule. I know of two women
well over ninety who cannot on this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
account take thyroid by itself for long.
After sixty, thyroid in combination with
pitglandin (the dried extract of the
pars-anterior of the hypophysis) becomes
very useful. At this time of life the
internal secretion of the sexual glands
begins to fail, and pitglandin, I think,
compensates for their deficiency. When
one thinks of the extraordinary influence
that the pars-anterior has in youth on
growth, and non-growth, causing gigantism
and infantilism, one cannot be
surprised at its having some powerful
influence at the other end of life. It
can be given in large doses, 1 or 2 grains,
and seems to have no poisonous effects.
Unlike pituitrin (pars-posterior), it does
not raise blood pressure, but, I believe,
has the opposite effect. The secretions
of testis and ovary are probably mild
pressure raisers, and as they enter into
the formation of nearly all the pluri-glandular
preparations that are on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
market, this should be recognized.
What may be of great value in neurasthenia,
where the pressure is generally
sub-normal, may be harmful in sclerosis.
Most of these preparations contain also
whole pituitary, and this again is harmful
in plus pressure. It always strikes
me as unscientific to give whole pituitary
in any case, for the two parts are largely
antagonistic in their action. The extracts
of the sexual glands have been
given, with the object of restoring sexual
power (except for its side effects a
thing of doubtful value), but if they
prove to be pressure raisers, sclerosis
will do better without them. In all
probability pitglandin has a stimulating
effect on the gonads, as it has on sexual
development in childhood, but it does
not raise pressure.</p>

<p>We must regard it as a clinical fact
that the thyroid reduces pressure. The
original experiments of Oliver and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
Schäfer seem conclusive. Brunton said:
“Thyroid gland, when taken by the
mouth, dilates the peripheral vessels,
making the skin warm and moist, and
quickens the pulse. In this respect it
antagonizes the suprarenal secretion.
Besides this effect on blood pressure, it
has other effects on metabolism which
are important.” Biedl says: “If
thyroid or iodothyrin be given continuously
for two or three weeks, the amount
of CO-excretion will be increased by 15
to 16 per cent. The nitrogenous interchanges
are invariably disturbed by
thyroid; the increased decomposition
of albumen is expressed by an increased
excretion of nitrogen. Thyroidism also
brings about a considerable increase in
the amount of calcium excreted in the
fæces, the calcium carrying off with it
a large proportion of phosphorus.”
This phosphorus loss may explain some
of the feeling of weakness and exhaustion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
that thyroid feeding often causes;
this a good phosphate food such as
Bynogen will help to remove.</p>

<p>It is thus evident that we have in
thyroid medication something much
more than a mere tension depressor.
Its other properties, influencing excretion,
explain to some extent its sphere
of usefulness and its drawbacks. The
increased excretion of calcium may be
very beneficial in atheroma, but is probably
not an advantage in other ways.
An observant man, who did not need
it, was taking thyroid rather freely;
he cut his finger and could not get it
to heal. Thinking that this might be
the result of calcium loss, he stopped
the thyroid, and his wound healed, as
he said, in a few hours. To the increased
general metabolism that thyroid produces
is due its striking effects in myxœdema:
the new tissues, abnormal in
quantity if not in essence, are absorbed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
and the face and limbs resume their
natural appearance. Senility and myxœdema
are so closely related that one
would naturally expect the same results
to ensue. A fair steady trial will prove
that such is the case, but all such clinical
experiments need to be carried out in
each individual case with thoroughness,
faith and intelligent observation. Failure
may at first be the verdict, but it is in
most cases due to some defect in method.
A thoughtful review of our physiological
knowledge of endocrine actions will
often show where lies the fault. A carping
critic may say, What is your physiological
knowledge of the action of
these glands? And one must humbly
answer, Not very much. But we are
going to find our way through the
twilight of our ignorance, partly by
physiological experiment, but chiefly by
clinical results. We must also be encouraged
by the thought that all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
clinical trials are without risk. What
matters it if we produce temporary
symptoms of hyperthyroidism? We can
always correct them or retrace our steps.
Russell Lowell’s proverb was, “A man
who never makes a mistake never makes
anything.” In such therapeutics we
shall discover the pathways of natural
curative medicine. It is not the introduction
into human bodies of vegetable
and mineral remedies or poisons; it is
simply the introduction of correlated
gland extracts from other mammals. As
far as we know, the glands of the herbivora
answer as well as the glands of
the omnivora, but we may have to
correct this view.</p>

<p>In treating hyperpiesis, we shall come
across some cases that seem to yield
to thyroid treatment hardly at all, and
here the trouble is often found to be
chiefly, if not entirely, in intestinal absorption
of deleterious products of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
faulty digestion; there may or may
not be signs of colitis; but, as I have
said before, duodenal extract freely given
alters the condition rapidly in most
cases. In these cases probably the
absorption of these residues of defective
digestion produces hyperadrenia, and
the adrenal-thyroid balance is disturbed.
Dr. Sajous (in his paper previously
mentioned) claims that calomel in very
small doses, not exceeding gr. <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">12</span></span></span>, is a
powerful activator of the thyroid secretion;
he claims that so given it has been
effective in checking epidemics of diphtheria.
It probably acts partly as an
intestinal bactericide and partly by its
action on the thyroid, increasing the
defensive anti-bodies in the blood.</p>

<p>There is one other medicine that has
a very decided action on some forms
of raised pressure, and that is hippuric
acid. This again is a natural or endogenous
cure. It was introduced by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
late Dr. George Oliver of Harrogate,
and is chiefly used as sodium or lithium
hippurate. For some time before his
death Dr. Oliver was seeking for a reasonable
explanation of its action, but his
death unfortunately came before he had
carried this through. I can give no
theory, but of its effects in many cases
I feel convinced, though I cannot say
beforehand in which class of case it
will answer. In the pre-sclerotic cases
of middle life it often acts quickly and
well, even better than thyroid. Again,
in old age, in cases where one would
expect thyroid to give the better results,
it answers equally well.</p>

<p>Two of my patients—old ladies well
over seventy—have had hyperpiesis for
twelve years or more; they were condemned
by good men many years ago.
They have lived on hippurate almost
without breaks all these years, and it
has kept their pressure down to a reasonable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
working-point. With both I
have tried thyroid treatment with very
slight success; they always come back
to their hippurate as the well-tried friend.
I have another patient aged ninety-four,
who has had periods of high pressure
for twenty years, and if she misses her
daily dose the pressure goes up and her
head gets giddy and confused. It is
a very wholesome medicine, causes no
gastric disturbance, and is easily soluble;
from 5 to 15 grains a day are generally
needed. If there are gouty symptoms
I give the lithia salt; if not, the sodium.
The benzoates have, I believe, much
the same action, but they are not easily
digested and large doses are required.
In bad and obstinate cases the hippurate
and thyroid treatment sometimes
act well together.</p>

<p>I have written now all that I know
from personal experience about the
treatment of this complicated condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
we call arterio-sclerosis; and many of
the symptoms and much of the treatment
I have been able to watch and
verify for myself by almost hourly contact
with it. Nevertheless, this treatment
will have to stand the racket and
assaults of both friendly and hostile
critics, and so it should be. In the
practice of medicine we must be prepared
to maintain our position and to give a
reason for the faith that is in us, for the
issues are so great and affect others
rather than ourselves.</p>

<p>I have said that this is somewhat of
an occupation disease: it is a vicious
circle, not originating necessarily in any
vice, but in the pressure of life and the
stress of circumstances. The causes often
we cannot remove entirely, but only
modify, and so we are compelled to
treat symptoms only; our ambition and
longing will be to do much more than
this—to bring about a perfect reform; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
in the management of this, as in most
morbid conditions, compromise, with as
much true wisdom as we can squeeze
into it, is the only practical policy. Our
endeavour must be to break the vicious
circle whenever and wherever we can.
The lowering of pressure does not sound
a great thing in itself, but it immediately
lessens the work of the heart, sets more
free the circulation of blood in the brain,
often restores the power of sleep and
so ensures comparative rest all round.
It thus gives us a breathing space in
which we can consider and attack the
origins of evil.</p>

<p>In conclusion I ask my readers to
consider well Sir Clifford Allbutt’s most
wise words on this question: “In
entering upon the discussion of vaso-dilatation,
as contrasted with agents
which bring about this change indirectly
by modifying the causes of morbid
constriction, we have to consider how
far mere dilatation—brought about, that
is to say, immediately and singly—serves
any good purpose.</p>

<p>“We are told that to act thus directly
upon the vessels is but to treat a symptom,
and is therefore absurd. But whatsoever
be our judgment on this or any
such particular effect, the common denunciation
of treating symptoms, which
sounds very philosophical, is surely but
a parrot phrase. Why should we not
treat a symptom? If in granular
kidney by mere pressure reduction the
grievous headache be abated, or in angina
pectoris the pain be thus charmed
away, we have so far at any rate a substantial
gain.</p>

<p>“In renal diseases it is generally agreed
that, on the whole, with due caution,
to lower pressure is helpful. Moreover,
if by mitigation of his suffering the
patient gets a chance of picking up in
many other ways, are we not more than
justified in our interference, narrow as
it may seem? We never know what
interference may cut a link in a vicious
circle. If we cannot stop the crack in
the water-pipe, we need not throw away
the mop.</p>

<p>“The warning should run not against
the treatment of a ‘mere symptom,’
but lest, while giving our attention to
the symptom and snatching at an immediate
advantage, we lose our grip of
the case as a whole.”</p>

<p>In whatever treatment we adopt for
sclerosis, we must bear in mind that,
under the raised pressure, the heart is
very apt to dilate. To lower pressure
alone in this condition often ends in
failure. We must brace up the heart
at the same time as we lower resistance.
For the purpose strophanthus in large
doses and strychnia are the best drugs.
Digitalis is occasionally necessary, but
more often does harm than good. Given,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>

pressure:</p>

<p>This can be taken three times daily
and acts best, I think, if taken before
food. The amount of thyroid can be
doubled if necessary. In cases where
there is much prostration the anterior
pituitary can be increased to 2 grains.
The orchitic and the ovarian can be
omitted if thought advisable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

<p>Hitherto many of us have looked on
this condition, arterio-sclerosis, as a
tenant’s fixture, to be got rid of only
when he moves into his next habitation.
This is neither fair to ourselves nor to
our patients. It is a hopeless stultification
of our more recent physiological
knowledge and discoveries. It is a
pessimistic faith that deserves failure and
gets it. It is a silent denial of those
healing powers which Christ so lovingly
displayed when on earth, and which are
still the heritage of those who can see
and believe.</p>

THE AUTUMN OF 1920. ORDER EARLY</p>

<p><b>Chats on Old Sheffield Plate.</b> By <span class="smcap">Arthur Hayden</span>.
With frontispiece and 53 full-page Illustrations, together
with makers’ marks. Cloth, about 10s. 6d. net.</p>

<p>Old plated ware has, by reason of its artistic excellence
and its technique, deservedly won favour with collectors.
The art of making plated ware, which originated at Sheffield
(hence the name “Sheffield plate”), was continued at
Birmingham and London, where a considerable amount
of “old Sheffield plate” was made, in the manner of its
first inventors, by welding sheets of silver upon copper.
The manufacture lasted roughly a hundred years. Its
best period was from 1776 (American Declaration of
Independence) to 1830 (Accession of William IV). The
author shows reasons why this old Sheffield plate should
be collected, and the volume is illustrated with many
examples giving various styles and the development of the
art, together with makers’ marks. Candlesticks and
candelabra, tea-caddies, sugar-baskets, salt-cellars, teapots,
coffee-pots, salvers, spoons, and many other articles
shown and described in the volume indicate the exquisite
craftsmanship of the best period. The work stands as a
companion volume to the author’s “Chats on Old Silver,”
the standard practical guide to old English silver collecting.</p>

<p><b>Bye Paths in Curio Collecting.</b> By <span class="smcap">Arthur Hayden</span>,
Author of “Chats on Old Silver,” etc. With a frontispiece
and 72 full-page Illustrations. Cloth, 21s. net. Second Impression.</p>

<p class="adquote">“Every collector knows the name of Mr. Arthur Hayden, and knows
him for a wise counsellor. Upon old furniture, old china, old pottery,
and old prints there is no more knowing judge in the country; and
in his latest volume he supplies a notable need, in the shape of a vade-mecum
exploring some of the nondescript and little traversed bye-paths
of the collector. There was never a time when the amateur
of the antique stood more in need of a competent guide.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.
The man who wishes to avoid the pitfalls of the fraudulent will
find much salutary advice in Mr. Hayden’s gossipy pages.
There are chests, for example, a fruitful field for reproduction.
Mr. Hayden gives photographs of many exquisite examples. There
is a marriage coffer of the sixteenth century, decorated with carved
figures of Cupid and Hymen, a fine Gothic chest of the fifteenth century,
with rich foliated decorations; and a superb livery cupboard
from Haddon Hall. From Flanders come steel coffers, with a lock
of four bolts, the heavy sides strongly braized together. Then there
are snuffers, with and without trays, tinder-boxes, snuff graters, and
metal tobacco stoppers. The most fascinating designs are shown,
with squirrels, dogs, and quaint human figures at the summit. Fans
and playing-cards provide another attractive section.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Chicken-skin, delicate, white,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Painted by Carlo van Loo.<br>

The fan has always been an object of the collector’s passion, because
of the grace of the article and its beauty as a display. Mr. Hayden
shows a particularly beautiful one, with designs after Fragonard,
the sticks of ivory with jewelled studs. Then there are watch-stands,
a little baroque in design, and table-bells, some of them shaped as
female figures with spreading skirts, old toys and picture-books, and,
of course, cradles, of which every English farm-house once boasted
its local variety. Altogether the book abounds in inviting pictures
and curious information, and is certain of a large, appreciative
public.”&emsp;<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

<p><b>SUNNY SONGS</b>. Poems. By <span class="smcap">Edgar A. Guest</span>. Cloth, 4/6 net.</p>

<p>In America Mr. Guest is an extraordinarily popular writer
of verses, though this is his first introduction in book form
to the British public. He brims over with sound sense
and tonic cheeriness. He is keenly sensible of the humour
of domestic life, but is deeply sympathetic with the
associations which combine in the word “Home.” Hence
he is read by women with amusement and pleasure. During
the war his poem, “Said the Workman to the Soldier,”
circulated by the hundred thousand. Like Béranger
and all successful poets, he is essentially lyrical; that
is to say, there is tune and swing in all his verses.</p>

<p class="adhead">THE ADVANCE OF SOUTH AMERICA<br>

<span class="fs85">A FEW NOTES ON SOME INTERESTING BOOKS
DEALING WITH THE PAST HISTORY, PRESENT AND
FUTURE POSSIBILITIES OF THE GREAT CONTINENT</span></p>

<p>When in 1906 Mr. Fisher Unwin commissioned the late
Major Martin Hume to prepare a series of volumes by
experts on the South American Republics, but little
interest had been taken in the country as a possible field
for commercial development. The chief reasons for this
were ignorance as to the trade conditions and the varied
resources of the country, and the general unrest and
instability of most of the governments. With the coming
of the South American Series of handbooks the financial
world began to realize the importance of the country,
and, with more settled conditions, began in earnest
to develop the remarkable natural resources which
awaited outside enterprise. Undoubtedly the most
informative books on the various Republics are those
included in <span class="smcap">The South American Series</span>, each of
which is the work of a recognized authority on his subject.</p>

<p class="adquote">“The output of books upon Latin America has in recent years been
very large, a proof doubtless of the increasing interest that is felt
in the subject. Of these the ‘South American Series’ is the most
noteworthy.”&emsp;<i>The Times.</i></p>

<p class="adquote">“When the ‘South American Series’ is completed, those who take
interest in Latin-American affairs will have an invaluable encyclopædia
at their disposal.”&emsp;<i>Westminster Gazette.</i></p>

<p class="adquote">“Mr. Unwin’s ‘South American Series’ of books are of special interest
and value to the capitalist and trader.”—<i>Chamber of Commerce Journal.</i></p>

Map. 2 vols. Cloth, 30/- net the set.</p>


<p>Starting with the various States of Central America, Mr.
Enock then describes ancient and modern Mexico, then
takes the reader successively along the Pacific Coast, the
Cordillera of the Andes, enters the land of the Spanish
Main, conducts the reader along the Amazon Valley, gives
a special chapter to Brazil and another to the River Plate
and Pampas. Thus all the States of Central and South
America are covered. The work is topographical, descriptive
and historical; it describes the people and the
cities, the flora and fauna, the varied resources of South
America, its trade, railways, its characteristics generally.</p>

<p class="adquote">“The book considers such questions as South American commerce,
British interests in the various Republics, international relations
and trade, communications, the tendency of enterprise, industries,
etc. Two chapters devoted to the needs of the continent will be
of especial interest to manufacturers and merchants, giving as they
do valuable hints as to the various goods required, while the chapter
on merchandise and commercial travellers affords some sound and
practical advice.”&emsp;<i>Chamber of Commerce Journal.</i></p>

strange scenes and with even more strange companions, and
vividly illustrates, by its graphic text and its admirable photographs,
the real conditions of life in the backwood regions of South
America.”&emsp;<i>Manchester Guardian.</i></p>

<p class="adquote">“Mr. Franck is to be congratulated on having produced a readable
and even fascinating book. His journey lay over countries in which
an increasing interest is being felt. Practically speaking, he may
be said to have started from Panama, wandered through Colombia,
spending some time at Bogota, and then going on to Ecuador, of
which Quito is the centre. Next he traversed the fascinating country
of the Incas, from the borders of which he entered Bolivia, going
right across that country till he approached Brazil. He passed
through Paraguay, cut through a corner of the Argentine to Uruguay,
and so to the River Plata and the now well-known town of Buenos
Ayres.”&emsp;<i>Country Life.</i></p>

of the American Museum of Natural History. With 48
Full-page Illustrations and with Maps. Cloth, 21/- net.</p>

<p>This volume represents a series of almost continuous
explorations hardly ever paralleled in the huge areas
traversed. The author is a distinguished field naturalist—one
of those who accompanied Colonel Roosevelt on
his famous South American expedition—and his first object
in his wanderings over 150,000 miles of territory was the
observation of wild life; but hardly second was that of
exploration. The result is a wonderfully informative,
impressive and often thrilling narrative in which savage
peoples and all but unknown animals largely figure, which
forms an infinitely readable book and one of rare value
for geographers, naturalists and other scientific men.</p>

<p class="adquote">“Mr. Harry Franck is a renowned vagabond with a gift for vivid
description.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. His record is well illustrated and he tells his story

done that one feels almost inclined to risk one’s life in a wild race
dwelling in a land of lurid beauty.”&emsp;<i>Liverpool Mercury.</i></p>

<p class="adquote">“This is an attractive book. There is a fascination about Mexico
which is all but irresistible.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. The authoress writes with
considerable descriptive power, and all through the stirring
narrative never permits us to lose sight of natural surroundings.”&emsp;<i>Dublin Review.</i></p>

<p><b>The Spell of the Tropics.</b> <span class="smcap">Poems.</span> By <span class="smcap">Randolph

<p>The author has travelled extensively in Central and South
America, and has strongly felt the spell of those tropic lands,
with all their splendour and romance, and yet about which
so little is known. The poems are striking pen-pictures
of life as it is lived by those men of the English-speaking
races whose lot is cast in the sun-bathed countries of
Latin-America. Mr. Atkin’s verses will reach the hearts
of all who feel the call of the wanderlust, and,
having shared their pleasures and hardships, his
poems will vividly recall to “old-timers” bygone
memories of days spent in the land of the Coconut Tree.</p>

<p>A complete history of the Belgian nation from its origins
to its present situation has not yet been published in this
country. Up till now Belgian history has only been
treated as a side issue in works concerned with the Belgian
art, Belgian literature or social conditions. Besides,
there has been some doubt with regard to the date at
which such a history ought to begin, and a good many
writers have limited themselves to the modern history
of Belgium because they did not see in olden times
sufficient evidence of Belgian unity. According to the
modern school of Belgian historians, however, this unity,
founded on common traditions and common interests,
has asserted itself again and again through the various
periods of history in spite of invasion, foreign domination
and the various trials experienced by the country. The
history of the Belgian nation appears to the modern mind
as a slow development of one nationality constituted by
two races speaking two different languages but bound
together by geographical, economic and cultural conditions.
In view of the recent proof Belgium has given
of her patriotism during the world-war, this impartial
enquiry into her origins may prove interesting to British
readers. Every opportunity has been taken to insist on
the frequent relationships between the Belgian provinces
and Great Britain from the early middle ages to the present
time, and to show the way in which both countries were
affected by them. Written by one of the most distinguished
Belgian writers, who has made a specialty of
his subject, this work will be one of the most brilliant and
informing contributions in “The Story of the Nations.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
